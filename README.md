# Identifying influential spreaders by a gravity model

This study aims to develop an improved gravity model that accurately identifies influential spreaders in complex networks by incorporating network topology, dynamics. The goal is to provide a more effective tool for identifying the most important nodes in a network.

Please find [report](Report.pdf) for the given project to understand to workflow of the code given.

# Dataset

Dataset is downloaded from [Here](https://github.com/MLIF/Network-Data)

I have used four dataset i.e. Email, PB, Router and Facebook.
